QuarkslaB Dynamic binary Instrumentation (QBDI) is a custom, tailored, cross platform and cross architecture DBI framework. It aims to support Linux, macOS, Android, iOS and Windows operating systems running on X86, X86_64, ARM and AArch64 architectures.

QBDI is still in an early stage of its development. It provides an engine able to execute arbitrary assembly code, and to insert instrumentation before and after instructions.

Even if young, X86_64 support is quite good. ARM support is in progress but already sufficient to execute simple CLI program like ls or cat. X86 and AArch64 are planned, but currently unsupported.
