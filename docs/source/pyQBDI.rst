PyQBDI
======

PyQBDI is a set of bindings that you can interact with through the use
of a preloaded library using **LD_PRELOAD** (linux) or **DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES** (macOS).
PyQBDI offers you a way to script your instrumentation, allowing a fast and easy way to design tools.
It also lets you interact with python environment, so you can, for example, post process any data
you collected during the instrumentation.

We provide examples along with the API documentation in the following sections.
