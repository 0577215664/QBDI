PyQBDI
======

PyQBDI is a set of bindings that you can interact with through the use 
of a preloaded library using **LD_PRELOAD** (linux) or **DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES** (macOS).
PyQBDI offers you a way to script your instrumentation, allowing a fast way to design tools. It also lets you interact with python environment, so you can, for example, to postprocess any data you collected during the instrumentation.
We provide examples along with the API documentation in the following sections.
